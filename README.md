# Speaking-Hands

The initial idea behind this device was to bridge the communication gap between mute and blind people. The glove helps capture sign language and converts it to speech so that the other person can understand the hand gestures without knowing the standard signs. This idea was then extended to not just any standard sign languages such as ASL(American Sign Language) or BSL(British Sign Language) but for people to come up with their very own sign language, thereby easing the communication further.
